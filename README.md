# TEAM-RUST-CAPSTONE-PROJECT
CGIAR Computer Vision for Crop Disease

This is iAspire 2020 Cohort 1 Capstone Projects.
The objective of this project is to build a machine learning algorithm to correctly classify if a plant is healthy, has stem rust, or has leaf rust.

An accurate image recognition model that can detect wheat rust from any image will enable a crowd-sourced approach to monitoring African crops, through avenues such as social media and smartphone images. This challenge represents a potential breakthrough in our ability to monitor and control plant diseases like wheat rust that affect African livelihoods.

The Team consist of three asiring Data Scientist and the final project will be presented
All codes,contributions and documentation beloong to Team Rust of the Aspire 2020 Cohort 1 Team.
